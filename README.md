# Multi-Agent Task Transfer System

This project implements a multi-agent system where tasks are dynamically assigned and transferred to the most suitable agent based on their capabilities or relevance. Each agent operates independently, and the system ensures efficient task distribution and collaboration among agents.

**Agents in the System:**
- **Career Agent:** Handles tasks related to career planning and progression.
- **Skills Agent:** Manages tasks involving skill assessment, development, and recommendations.
- **Job Agent:** Responsible for tasks related to job searching, matching, and applications.

**Key Features:**
- Multiple autonomous agents (career, skills, job)
- Task assignment based on agent relevance
- Dynamic task transfer between agents
- Scalable and modular architecture

## Usage

1. Define agents and their capabilities.
2. Submit tasks to the system.
3. The system automatically assigns or transfers tasks to the appropriate agent.
